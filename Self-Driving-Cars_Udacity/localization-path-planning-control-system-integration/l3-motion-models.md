### 5. note on frames of reference

- localizationやsensor fusionのframe of referenceの区別：

| Localization                                                 | Sensor Fusion                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Things are in vehicle coordinates OR map coordinates. The entire  objective of localization is to **find the transformation between vehicle  coordinates and map coordinates**. In other words, we’re trying to find  the position of the car in the map! | Everything is in vehicle coordinates where the x axis points in the  direction of the car’s heading and the y axis points to the left of the  car. |
| The position of the car is described in map coordinates.     | The car is always assumed to be at the origin of the vehicle coordinate system. |
| The sensor measurements are usually described in vehicle  coordinates. Vehicle coordinates have the x-axis in the direction of the car’s heading, the y-axis pointing orthogonal to the left of the car,  and the z-axis pointing upwards. | Sensor measurements are in vehicle coordinates.              |
| Map landmarks are in map coordinates.                        | **There’s no map involved**!                                 |
