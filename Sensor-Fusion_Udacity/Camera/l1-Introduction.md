- Cameras are the **only sensors** able to **interpret 2D information** such as **road signs** or **lane markings**.
- After decades of engineering, it is safe to say that cameras are a very mature technology. But the main problem is still that they are subject to the same drawbacks as the human eyes.
- Computer visionのtwo broad types:
  - Classic: feature tracking, segmentation, 3D reconstruction and also object recognition.
  - Deep learning.
    - It's often hard to understand how a trained network works, which makes it really hard to pinpoint certain problems and to solve them.
